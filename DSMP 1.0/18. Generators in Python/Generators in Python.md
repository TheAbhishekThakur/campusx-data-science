# Generators in Python
- Python Generators are a simple and powerful tool for creating iterators. 

- They allow you to iterate through a sequence of values without the need to store the entire sequence in memory at once. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences.

## Benefits of Generators:

1. Ease of Implementation
2. Memory Efficiency
3. Represent Infinite Stream of Data
4. Composability
5. Improved Performance
