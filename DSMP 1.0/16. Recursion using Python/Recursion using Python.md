# Recursion using Python

Recursion is when a function calls itself directly or indirectly in order to solve a problem.

It’s typically used when a problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of the same type.

## Structure of a Recursive Function

A recursive function always has two parts:

1. Base Case – the condition that stops the recursion (prevents infinite loop).

2. Recursive Case – the part where the function calls itself with a smaller/simpler input.
