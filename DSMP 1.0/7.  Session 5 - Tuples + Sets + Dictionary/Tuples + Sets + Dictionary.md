# Tuples
A tuple in Python is similar to a list. The difference between the two is that we cannot change the elements of a tuple once it is assigned whereas we can change the elements of a list.

In short, a tuple is an immutable list. A tuple can not be changed in any way once it is created.

## Characterstics

1. Ordered
2. Unchangeble
3. Allows duplicate

## Plan of Attack

1. Creating a Tupple
2. Accessing items
3. Editing items
4. Adding items
5. Deleting items
6. Operations on Tuples
7. Tuple Functions

## Differences between Tuples and Lists

1. Syntax
2. Mutability :- Tuples are immutable but Lists are mutable.
3. Speed :- Tuples are faster than Lists.
4. Memory :- Tuple takes less memory than list.
5. Built-In functionality :- In list built in functionality is more than tuple.
6. Error prone :- List works on shallow copy to there is more chances top handle error but in case of tuple it works on deep copy.
7. Usability :- The major difference is mutable/immutable. So acciording to use cases you can use Tuple or List.
