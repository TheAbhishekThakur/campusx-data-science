## Object
Object is an instance of the class.

## Methods vs Functions
If there is any function inside a class then it's called Method. But if there is a function outside the class then it's called Function.

## What are the benifits of constructor

1. `Automatic Initialization`: When you create an object, the constructor runs automatically without you having to call it manually.

2. `Code Reusability`: Instead of writing initialization code every time you create an object, you define it once in the constructor.

3. `Encapsulation of Setup Logic`: You can put all the "setup" or "preparation" logic inside the constructor so objects are always ready to use.
